## Overview

This vignette explains how to upload and analyse a custom gene set in the singscore Shiny app.

---

## File Format

Upload a `.csv` or `.tsv` file with the following two columns:

| Pathway  | Gene   |
|----------|--------|
| TEST123  | PMEL   |
| TEST123  | MLANA  |
| TEST123  | SOX10  |

**Column names must be exactly `Pathway` and `Gene`.**

---

## Uploading

1. Navigate to the **Import Data** section.
2. Use the **"Upload Custom Gene Set"** input to upload your file.
3. Click **Submit Data**.

---

## Output

Once uploaded:

- The app will automatically parse your file and use it to compute singscores.
- You’ll see your gene set(s) under “Genes in Selected Signature(s)”.
- Merging with the default dataset is automatically disabled for custom gene sets.

## Example File

Here is a valid example saved as CSV:

```csv
